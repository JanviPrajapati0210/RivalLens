"""
Aspect extraction: figures out which product aspect (delivery, pricing,
support, etc.) a mention is actually about, so sentiment can be broken
down per-aspect instead of one blended score per brand.

Approach: spaCy noun-chunk extraction + keyword matching against a curated
aspect vocabulary. This is intentionally simple (not a trained classifier) —
good enough for an MVP, and every aspect bucket is easy to explain in a demo.
Swap in a trained classifier later if the keyword lists stop covering enough
of the mention volume.
